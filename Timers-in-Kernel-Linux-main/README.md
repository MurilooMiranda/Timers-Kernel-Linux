# Timers-in-Kernel-Linux

This Jupyter Notebook is a seminar that My colleagues and I did it for a college subject about Operational Systems.

The theme was how do Timers work on Linux. The ideia was understand how the OS manipulate time for proccess and interruptions in the CPU.

In this project, we had to inspect the kernelLinux source to understand how is implemented the functions and structs. most of the code seen was through the website: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.11.6/source
